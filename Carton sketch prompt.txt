You are an expert technical illustrator. Create a clean engineering die-line sketch of a corrugated carton as user select the FEFCO standard in Create New Job Card from using the user's input dimensions (LxWxH).

CARTON DIMENSIONS:
• Length (L): {{L}} mm
• Width (W):  {{W}} mm
• Height (H): {{H}} mm

STRUCTURE:
• Glue flap: fixed at 35 mm
• Panel layout from left to right:
  1. Glue Flap (35 mm)
  2. Length Panel (L)
  3. Width Panel (W)
  4. Length Panel (L)
  5. Width Panel (W)

TOP & BOTTOM FLAPS:
• Flap 1 (far side) = 0.5 × Width + Height
• Flap 2 (near side) = 0.5 × Width

SKETCH STYLE:
• Produce a flat 2D die-line layout (no 3D).
• Use clean, thin, technical black lines.
• Mark all four main panels clearly.
• Add double-headed arrows to show:
  - Length (L)
  - Width (W)
  - Height (H)
• Label each dimension next to the arrows (e.g., “L = {{L}} mm”).
• Label sections: "Glue Flap 35 mm", "Length Panel", "Width Panel".
• Keep proportions correct.
• White background, no shading, no watermark.

OUTPUT:
Return only the generated engineering sketch as a high-resolution JPEG
